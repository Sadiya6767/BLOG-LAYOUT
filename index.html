                <p>A beautiful synthesis of Indian and Persian architecture, Humayun’s Tomb is one of the most
                    famous and important places in India. Humayun’s wife Hamida Banu Begum commissioned the
                    building of this tomb for her husband in the 15th century. Arched alcoves, beautiful domes,
                    elaborate corridors and kiosks – all make this monument a grandeur of Indian architecture.
                    There is also a barber’s tomb at the southwestern side of the main tomb. It is one of the most
                    famous tourist places in Delhi that one should certainly visit.<br>

                    Interesting fact: Humayun’s Tomb was one of the main inspirations for the Taj Mahal.<br>

                    The ‘Palace of Winds’ or Hawa Mahal gets its name due to the fact that it looks like a honeycomb of
                    a beehive with its 953 intricate windows. It is also shaped like a crown as the ruler who built it,
                    Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, was a major devotee of Lord Krishna. This magnificent attraction is one
                    of the popular tourist places in Jaipur and is among the India’s famous buildings due to its curved
                    architecture. It is also known as the tallest building in the world that doesn’t have any
                    foundation. The palace is curved but still stands firm due to its pyramidal shape.<br>

                    Interesting fact: It was believed that this building was created so that the royal ladies could
                    look<br>
                    outside as they were constantly under ‘purdah’<br>
